CSS: 



ABSOLUTE UNITs:
px:  Pixel are considred absolute units . every screen/device has diff px. px unit is fixed
and is not relative to other element. due to this it is difficult to use in responsiveness
but better to use where maintaing static sizing of elements/when resizing of element is not needed.

px vs vh/vw:
pz is fixed but vh/vw changes according to the whole screen size of device.hence, they help increse responsiveness.
They are mostly used fo margins/padding/spacing/w/ht etc while px is mostly used for font sizing ,% etc.

RELATIVE UNITS:

1. EM: relative to parent element . matlab jis element ke anadr woh defined hai
    1em=16px(1*16)
    2em=32px(2*16) iska matlab parent size 16 px hai 
2.REM: realtive to root element. root is html and never body.
