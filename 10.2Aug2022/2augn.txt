lines of commnads that are called when needed


in here, script tag is defined inside head but still the functions work. 
this is because the body one will be loaded first and the function will be called only after the button line is loaded
so there is no problem in this and it will work fine.




Number will only convert var into number when the value inside the var is actually number


<span> : inline element that lets us do styling at a particular part.
isNan : an inbulit function to check whetre the given number is isNan
