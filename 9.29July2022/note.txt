JS is a lightweight,interpreted or just in time 
provides a functinality to a website both server and client side.
helps provide some behaviour in a dynamic website
most of it libraries work in front end except for node that is the only librarby that works in backend
only 3 keywords used:
let: assisgn a varible
var: to declare a variable but in this if declared globally and one locally, the one locally will be considered.
const: declared once and remains same throughout the program (no datatypes or anything)



can be chlaing in 2 ways:
1. node: JavaScript ka code chal jata hai ismein
2.HTML: iske sath JS chalenge toh node ki no need


inside HTML doc. JS can be written inside the <script> tag

console.log(); ka matlab hai jo console hai output wahan print ho
console ka main use debugging ke liye, to create log file and to open server files.

getElementById('id name').innerHTML/Text=var_name : to show the outputfile in HTMl doc on web.
toh id ko access karke uske inner mein var ko access karenge

innerHTML matlab tag ke andar ki html change hogi
innerText means tag ke nadra ka text change hoga

JS is highly popular among machine learning comapred to c++ and java because the AI and robot code needs whole source code
and the machine keeps on learning and making changes in the source code which is made possible by JS.
